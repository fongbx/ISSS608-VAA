For education level, should change to factor and change the level\n\n-   FinancialJournal - change the diff categories of income/expenses into individual columns - use pivoting / extract year_month from date\n\n    -   Must be able to apply appropriate data wrangling methods to derive analytics\\\n        table at participant level\n\n    -   Encode all expenses into positive\n\n    -   Must be able to flag out 131 participants which are potentially no longer resident\\\n        in the city.\n\n    -   Must be able to flag potential anomalous wages on 1st March 2018\n\n-   Take note whether got duplicates / spelling errors?\n\nPlotting\n\n-   When plotting out, good to include more comments in code chunk to explain\n\n-   When we want to show normality, instead of showing statistical results, need to see how to present in charts (qqplot) + statistical results beside\n\n-   When we use ggstatsplot, remember to set.seed else will always get different results\n\n-   In real-life we always assume we do not know the population variance, so will use unequal variance (ggbetweenplot default equal var already set to False so no need to adjust)\n\n-   First do normality test, if not normal then we use non-parametric, and the centrality measure is median\n\n-   Don't have to generate too many plots/analyses. Focus on some areas.\n",
